    "# Earnings Open Interest Shift Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to trade earnings announcements using a couple different indicators with the assumption as follows: The options markets are more sophisticated than the equity markets are, and are able to understand news better. Thus, we want to develop a signal as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We find that option tradersâ€™ information processing ability stems primarily from\n",
    "> their ability to identify underreaction to news: their trades on news days are only\n",
    "> informative about future stock prices when they buy call options on stocks that have\n",
    "> experienced positive news events and when they buy put options on stocks that have\n",
    "> experienced negative news events, while otherwise their trades are on average uninformative.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> -[M. Cremers, A.Fodor, D. Weinbaum][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "We have pulled earnings surprise data from [StreetInsider.com](http://www.streetinsider.com/), and thus\n",
    "can determine ahead of time whether earnings were \"positive\" or \"negative\" news by their surprises.\n",
    "We will test logic to determine how \"positive\" or \"negative\" these surprises are; we expect that many\n",
    "will have very small surprises and thus be a neutral event overall. We do not want to trade these events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we need to define a proxy for what it means to \"buy call options\" or \"buy put options.\"\n",
    "We use as a proxy for buying pressure in one direction or the other the Open Interest of an option.\n",
    "For example, if we see that call open interest increases while put open interest decreases, we\n",
    "determine that this is \"buying call option\" behavior.\n",
